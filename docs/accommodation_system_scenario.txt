The Accommodation Management System is a Java console application backed by a MySQL database that allows admins, guests, and restaurant owners to securely sign up, log in, and reset passwords. Admins can add, view, and delete their listed properties while also viewing detailed booking reports for each accommodation. Guests can browse all available properties, make bookings, and view their personal booking history. Restaurant owners can manage their own restaurant listings by cuisine type and remove entries as needed. The system enforces role-based access control to ensure each user only sees the menus and options relevant to their permissions. All booking and payment data is recorded in the database, with a dedicated Payment module handling transaction IDs, timestamps, and payment status updates. The intuitive console menus guide users step-by-step through accommodation searches, restaurant browsing, booking workflows, and payment processing. Together, these features provide a streamlined, end-to-end solution for managing accommodations, dining options, and payments in a single cohesive platform.
